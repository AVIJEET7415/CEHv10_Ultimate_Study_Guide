# Hacking Mobile Platforms

### <u>Mobile Platform Attack Vectors</u>

- **OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks**
  - **M1 - Improper Platform Usage** - misuse of features or security controls (Android intents, TouchID, Keychain)
  - **M2 - Insecure Data Storage** - improperly stored data and data leakage
  - **M3 - Insecure Communication** - poor handshaking, incorrect SSL, clear-text communication
  - **M4 - Insecure Authentication** - authenticating end user or bad session management
  - **M5 - Insufficient Cryptography** - code that applies cryptography to an asset, but is insufficient (does NOT include SSL/TLS)
  - **M6 - Insecure Authorization** - failures in authroization (access rights)
  - **M7 - Client Code Quality** - catchall for code-level implementation problems
  - **M8 - Code Tampering** - binary patching, resource modification, dynamic memory modification
  - **M9 - Reverse Engineering** - reversing core binaries to find problems and exploits
  - **M10 - Extraneous Functionality** - catchall for backdoors that were inadvertently placed by coders
